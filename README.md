I completed the assignment by essentially messing with the x and y integers which change positions of the animals, creating a new animal with a different porition, and finally coded an animal to follow the mouse cursor.

 * main4.pyâ€”*extra credit*:
   * Find some other sprites, and make them into a collage
   * Using what you have learned in the other exercise files, draw at least ten sprites in the window
   * [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) or [openGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) are resources for free images
   * If you would like to make them move or react to the mouse, I will award extra points
